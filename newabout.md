# m0chan's GitHub Page

## About Me
I am known as m0chan/mochan online & Aidan in real life - I am a Red Teamer/Pentester based in Scotland working on mainly network & webapp based assessments. I created this GitHub so I have a platform to share my scripts, resources & finally to publish any CTF/VulnHub writeups. 

## HackTheBox Writeups

As I am aiming to become OSCP certified and undertake the dreaded OSCP course at some point I work on HackTheBox boxes and aim to root as many as I possibly can! Below you can find writeups of retired boxes which I have succesfully rooted / gained system privs on.
